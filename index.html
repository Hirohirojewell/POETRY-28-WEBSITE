        <h2>When Our Paths Crossed</h2>
        <div class="poem">
            <p>
                Once upon a pixel, so sweet and so bright,
                In the vast world of screens, one fateful night,
                A humble Sandwich, all layered and neat,
                Caught the eye of a Donut, so soft and so sweet.
           </p>
            <p>
                He sat on the shelf, his bread crisp and fine,
                A little bit cheesy, with pickles in line.
                She twirled through the internet, sugar in her soul,
                A circle of sweetness, a sugary goal.
           </p>
            <p>
                Their paths crossed in a chatroom, so wide,
                A message popped up, "Hello, care to collide?"
                "Hi, I'm Sandwich," he typed with a grin,
                "I’m Donut," she said, "Shall we dive in?"
           </p>
            <p>
                Their words were like frosting, so smooth and so kind,
                She shared her glaze, he shared his bread line.
                He told her of mustard, of meat and of cheese,
                She laughed at his toppings, said "What a tease!"
           </p>
            <p>
                But then, as they chatted, both started to see,
                They were more than just snacks, they were meant to be.
                He admired her sweetness, the holes in her heart,
                She loved how his layers made him a work of art.
           </p>
            <p>
                Through pixel and text, their bond grew so tight,
                Every message a bite, every laugh pure delight.
                They learned how to balance, like sugar and spice,
                Finding joy in each other, not once thinking twice.
           </p>
            <p>
                One evening, he asked, with a soft little wink,
                "Would you be mine, Donut, let's link?"
                With sprinkles and cream, her answer was clear,
                "I’ve fallen for you, Sandwich, so near and so dear."
           </p>
            <p>
                And so, in this world, they continued to share,
                Their love built online, a delicious affair.
                Sandwich and Donut, together they'd stay,
                Their love, like a snack, would never decay.
